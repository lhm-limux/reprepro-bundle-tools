This tool can be used to merge packages from different sources (so called
supplier-suites) into a separate apt repository (managed by reprepro in the
background), the so called "bundle". It provides an easy to use workflow for
adding new bundles, and selecting packages, Upgrades and Downgrades that
should be applied to the bundle and sealing a bundle for deployment.
Additionally each bundle could be provided with metadata that could be useful
to automate deployment processes.

positional arguments:
  {init,edit,blacklist,black,meta,show,list,ls,seal,apply,clone,bundles,lsb,update-repos-config,repos}

    init                Subcommand init: Reserves a new bundle ID and creates
                        a new empty bundle for the given distribution
    edit                Subcommand edit: Add / Remove/ Upgrade/ Downgrade
                        packages to/in the bundle by editing an automatically

                        mark particular binary packages contained in a source
                        package as blacklisted. Blacklisted packages will not
                        be added to the bundle.
